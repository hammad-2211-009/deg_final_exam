# Final exam

Final exam tasks are located in the subdirectories of this directory:
1. [50 pts] `docker`
2. [75 pts] `testing`
3. [125 pts] `kafka_pyspark`
4. [100 pts] `architecture`
5. [250 pts] `data_pipeline`

In total there are 600 points to get. Each task is worth different number of points which hints you how long it might take. Take this into account and don't get stuck on one task! Try to manage your time as well as you can.

Each of you should create a private github repository named `<roll_number>_final_exam_solutions` where you will store your solutions. **Create a new repository, do not fork this one**. The repository should have a `README.md` file with your roll number and name, and following directories: `docker`, `testing`, `kafka_pyspark`, `architecture`, `data_pipeline`. Place your solutions in corresponding directories. After you're done with the whole exam, [download your repository as zip](https://sites.northwestern.edu/researchcomputing/resources/downloading-from-github/) and submit it in LMS (whole repository for each task, so effectively you submit the same file couple of times).

You have whole working day to solve the tasks: 10h. The tasks were designed with 8h exam in mind so you should have some extra time.

Good luck! :)
